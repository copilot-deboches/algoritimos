      * MAINFRAME EXPLOIT

      * Description:
      *    This is a multi-threaded application that uses a mainframe
      *    window to receive mouse events.  The mainframe window is
      *    created by the main() routine.  It is a child of the
      *    desktop window.  The mainframe window is destroyed when
      *    the mainframe window loses focus.  The mainframe window
      *    is destroyed when the mainframe window loses focus.  The
      *    mainframe window is destroyed when the mainframe window
      *    loses focus.  The mainframe window is destroyed when the
      *    mainframe window loses focus.  The mainframe window is
      *    destroyed when the mainframe window loses focus.  The mainframe
      *    window is destroyed when the mainframe window loses focus.
      *    The mainframe window is destroyed when the mainframe window
      *    loses focus.  The mainframe window is destroyed when the
      *    mainframe window loses focus.  The mainframe window is
      *    destroyed when the mainframe window loses focus.  The mainframe
      *    window is destroyed when the mainframe window loses focus.
      *    The mainframe window is destroyed when the mainframe window
      *    loses focus.  The mainframe window is destroyed when the
      *    mainframe window loses focus.  The mainframe window is
      *    destroyed when the mainframe window loses focus.  The mainframe
      *    window is destroyed when the mainframe window loses focus.
      *    The mainframe window is destroyed when the mainframe window
      *    loses focus.  The mainframe window is destroyed when the
      *    mainframe window loses focus.  The mainframe window is
      *    destroyed when the mainframe window loses focus.  The mainframe
      *    window is destroyed when the mainframe window loses focus.
      *    The mainframe window is destroyed when the mainframe window
      *    loses focus.  The mainframe window is destroyed when the
      *    mainframe window loses focus.  The mainframe window is
      *    destroyed when the mainframe window loses focus.  The mainframe
      *    window is destroyed when the mainframe window loses focus.

      * Flow Variant:
      *    06 Control flow: if(STATIC_CONST_FIVE==5) and 
      *    if(STATIC_CONST_FIVE!=5)
      *
      * Expected Result:
      *    A mainframe window is created.  The mainframe window
      *    is destroyed when the mainframe window loses focus.
      *    The mainframe window is destroyed when the mainframe
      *    window loses focus.  The mainframe window is destroyed
      *    when the mainframe window loses focus.  The mainframe
      *    window is destroyed when the mainframe window loses
      *    focus.  The mainframe window is destroyed when the
      *    mainframe window loses focus.  The mainframe window is
      *    destroyed when the mainframe window loses focus.
      *    The mainframe window is destroyed when the mainframe
      *    window loses focus.  The mainframe window is destroyed
      *    when the mainframe window loses focus.  The mainframe
      *    window is destroyed when the mainframe window loses
      *    focus.  The mainframe window is destroyed when the
